Elaborated Points for an Ed-Tech Company
Here are the 13 points, elaborated for an ed-tech company, with a focus on strategy and implementation:

1. Find Leads Through Webinars
Strategy: Host regular webinars on trending topics in technology (e.g., AI, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity). The webinars should be free to attend and provide valuable insights.

Implementation: Use webinar registration forms to collect contact information (leads). Follow up with attendees to understand their learning goals and promote relevant courses.

2. Collect Data of Recent 12th-Grade Graduates
Strategy: Target the demographic of students who have just completed high school, as they are actively searching for higher education and career-oriented courses.

Implementation: Partner with high schools or educational portals to run campaigns. Offer free career counseling sessions or aptitude tests in exchange for student data.

3. Conduct Free Webinars for Tech Domain Selection
Strategy: Many students are unsure about which tech domain to pursue. Offering guidance helps build trust and positions your company as an expert.

Implementation: Host interactive webinars with industry experts who can explain different tech domains, career paths, and skill requirements. Use this as a funnel to enroll students in foundational courses.

4. Suggest a 4-Year Package with Placement Benefits
Strategy: Create a comprehensive, long-term program that mirrors a traditional degree but is more industry-focused. This provides a structured path and career security.

Implementation: Offer a 4-year learning path covering core tech skills, internships, and soft skills. Guarantee placement support to attract students looking for a direct path to employment.

5. Conduct Competitions or Tests for Scholarships
Strategy: Use competitions to attract a large number of students and identify high-potential learners. Scholarships make your courses more accessible and appealing.

Implementation: Host a coding challenge, a quiz on tech fundamentals, or an aptitude test. The top performers receive scholarships, which generates buzz and increases enrollment.

6. Showcase Recently Passed-Out Students
Strategy: Social proof is a powerful marketing tool. Highlighting the success of your alumni builds credibility and demonstrates the effectiveness of your courses.

Implementation: Create a "Success Stories" section on your website and social media. Feature video testimonials and articles about alumni who secured jobs at reputable tech companies, mentioning their roles and salaries.

7. Collaborate with Colleges
Strategy: Partnering with colleges allows you to access a large student base and integrate your courses into their curriculum, enhancing their offerings.

Implementation: Offer your courses as elective credits or as part of a joint certification program. Provide workshops, guest lectures, or career fairs in collaboration with college career services.

8. Track Student Journey and Send Personalized Recommendations
Strategy: Use data analytics to understand student behavior, engagement, and learning patterns. This enables you to provide a more personalized and effective learning experience.

Implementation: Track course completion rates, video watch times, and quiz scores. Based on this data, recommend the next logical course, send motivational reminders, or suggest supplementary resources to keep students engaged.

9. Collaborate with Famous Influencers
Strategy: Influencers have a built-in audience and high credibility. Partnering with them can significantly boost your brand's visibility and attract new users.

Implementation: Work with tech YouTubers, bloggers, or podcasters to create a "pilot course" or a series of free tutorials. Use their platform to promote your full-fledged courses and special offers.

10. Offer Free Basic Computer Components
Strategy: Provide high-quality, free content to attract a wide audience. This acts as a lead magnet and demonstrates the quality of your paid courses.

Implementation: Create a free, foundational course on topics like "Introduction to Python," "Basic Networking," or "Data Structures & Algorithms." After students complete the free course, offer them a discount on a more advanced, premium course.

11. Create Recommendation Engines
Strategy: A recommendation engine uses data to suggest relevant courses to a user, increasing their engagement and the likelihood of them enrolling in more courses.

Implementation: Based on a user's course history, search queries, or quiz performance, the system should suggest other related courses they might be interested in. For example, if a user completes a Python course, the engine could recommend a course on Django or data science with Python.

12. Provide Mentors
Strategy: Mentorship adds significant value to a course, providing personalized guidance and career advice that automated platforms cannot.

Implementation: Offer live Q&A sessions with mentors, one-on-one career counseling, or a dedicated chat channel where students can ask questions and receive expert advice.

13. Provide an EMI Option to Pay After Graduation
Strategy: Financial barriers often prevent students from enrolling in expensive courses. A "study now, pay later" model makes education more accessible.

Implementation: Partner with a financial service provider to offer an Income Share Agreement (ISA) or an EMI plan. Students can enroll in a high-value course and start paying for it in installments once they secure a job after graduation.
