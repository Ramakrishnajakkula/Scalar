# AI-Powered Lead Re-engagement Funnel for EdTech

## üìã Project Overview

This project presents an AI-powered solution for re-engaging cold leads in an EdTech context. By leveraging various AI technologies, I've designed and implemented a comprehensive funnel that segments, personalizes, and guides cold leads back into the conversion pipeline.

## üéØ Problem Statement

**The Challenge:** EdTech companies acquire numerous leads, but many go cold over time, representing a significant loss of potential revenue and educational opportunity.

**Key Issues:**
- Large databases of cold leads with untapped potential
- Generic re-engagement attempts that lack personalization
- Manual follow-up processes that don't scale
- Inability to identify which leads are worth pursuing
- Missing insights about lead preferences and needs

## üí° The Solution: AI-Powered Re-engagement Funnel

I've developed a comprehensive AI-powered funnel that:
1. **Segments cold leads** using clustering algorithms
2. **Personalizes communication** with NLP and generative AI
3. **Delivers relevant content** via recommendation systems
4. **Assesses skills and needs** through adaptive assessments
5. **Provides guidance** with conversational AI
6. **Recommends courses** based on individual profiles

The funnel follows these key stages:
1. **Segmentation**: AI clustering to identify high-value cold leads
2. **Re-engagement**: Personalized outreach based on segments
3. **Value Delivery**: Educational content tailored to interests
4. **Assessment**: Interactive skill evaluation and feedback
5. **Guidance**: AI-powered career and learning recommendations
6. **Conversion**: Personalized course offerings and enrollment
