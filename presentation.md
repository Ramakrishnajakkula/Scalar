# Scaler AI APM Intern Assignment - Presentation

## AI-Powered Lead Re-engagement Funnel for EdTech

### Project Overview

This presentation outlines our solution for an AI-powered lead acquisition and conversion funnel for an edtech offering. We identified re-engaging cold leads as a key growth opportunity, designed a comprehensive funnel architecture, and developed prototype implementations of critical AI touchpoints.

- Personalization at scale through segmentation and AI
- Adaptive content based on lead behavior and preferences
- Automated engagement that feels human and relevant

### Target Metrics
- 30% increase in re-activated cold leads
- 20% improvement in conversion rates
- 25% reduction in customer acquisition costs
- 40% increase in engagement with educational content
